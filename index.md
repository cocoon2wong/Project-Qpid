## Abstract

This is the homepage of our code repository **Project-Qpid**.
This repository was created to facilitate the construction, training and testing of our trajectory prediction models (using the pytorch backend now).
It includes some basic dataset preprocessing and reading as well as training and testing functions to keep our approaches' code repositories compatible with each other and easy to be managed.
Click the following buttons to learn how it works.
