A dataset consists of split files, clip files, and data files.
Split files define training, testing, and validation sets for each clip.
Clip files contain metadata about each video clip, including paths and configurations.
Data files are CSVs containing frame IDs, agent names, trajectories, and types.
This page describes how these files are organized in the `qpid` package.

## Organization of Dataset Files

A dataset can have multiple video clips (or subsets), and the way we split these clips into different train, test, and validation sets is the corresponding split.
This means that a dataset can have multiple splits, but these splits will all refer to the same clip files.
Our processed dataset files have two main parts: the data files in the `./dataset_processed` folder and the config files in the `./dataset_configs` folder.
We store different dataset split files and data files in the following way, using `ETH-UCY` as an example:

```html
/ (Storge root path)
|___dataset_configs
    |___ETH-UCY
        |___eth.plist       (⬅️ Here are all **split** config files)
        |___hotel.plist
        |___...
        |___subsets         (⬅️ It contains all **clip** config files)
            |___eth.plist
            |___hotel.plist
            |___...
|___dataset_processed
    |___ETH-UCY
        |___eth
            |___ann.csv     (⬅️ Transformed dataset annotation file in each **clip**)
        |___hotel
            |___ann.csv
        |___...
```

You can also organize data files and config files in the same way to test or train models on your own datasets.
A dataset contains at least three kinds of files, `split file`s, `clip file`s, and `data file`s.
The formats of these files will be introduced below.

## Format of a Split File

The config file of a dataset split contains a `dict` that includes the following items:

- **anntype**, type=`string`: Annotation type of the dataset;
- **dataset**, type=`string`: Name of the dataset;
- **dimension**, type=`integer`: Dimension of the trajectory;
- **scale**, type=`real`: Scaling factor when transforming the original data file;
- **scale_vis**, type=`real`: Scaling factor when drawing visualized results on 2D images;
- **test**, type=`array`: An array of clips to test the model;
- **train**, type=`array`: An array of clips to train the model;
- **type**, type=`string`: Annotation type; (It is now unused.)
- **val**, type=`array`: An array of clips to validate the model when training.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to differences in settings, validation sets may not be included in the split of some datasets.
> When creating data config files, validation sets are still needed, even though they may be the same as the test set.

You can take the config file of the **split** (NOT *clip*) `eth.plist` in dataset `ETH-UCY` as an example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>anntype</key>
    <string>coordinate</string>
    <key>dataset</key>
    <string>ETH-UCY</string>
    <key>dimension</key>
    <integer>2</integer>
    <key>scale</key>
    <real>1.0</real>
    <key>scale_vis</key>
    <real>1.0</real>
    <key>test</key>
    <array>
        <string>eth</string>
    </array>
    <key>train</key>
    <array>
        <string>hotel</string>
        <string>univ</string>
        <string>zara1</string>
        <string>zara2</string>
        <string>univ3</string>
        <string>unive</string>
        <string>zara3</string>
    </array>
    <key>type</key>
    <string>meter</string>
    <key>val</key>
    <array>
        <string>eth</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Format of a Clip File

A `clip file` is also a `plist` file that save some of the variables and configurations in each of the video clips.
It contains a `dict` that includes the following items:

- **annpath**, type=`string`: Path of the data `csv` file of this video clip;
- **dataset**, type=`string`: Name of the dataset that the video clip belongs to;
- **matrix**, type=`array`: An array of numbers to transform annotations with meters into pixels, and it is only used when drawing 2D visualized results on scene images;
- **name**, type=`string`: Name of the video clip;
- **order**, type=`array`: ~~It is only used when drawing visualized results on 2D images to judge the x-y order of the dataset file.~~ ***This item is now DEPRECATED.*** Please leave it a `[0, 1]` array for all 2D cases;
- **other_files**: *(Optional)* Other paths of the related files, like the static RGB images or segmentation maps of the video clip;
- **paras**, type=`array`: It includes two numbers, where `paras[0]` is the sample interval (frames between each two adjacent recorded lines in the annotation file) in frames, and `paras[1]` is the frame rate of the video clip;
- **video_path**, type=`string`: Path of the video file of this clip.

You can take the config file `zara1.plist` of the video clip `zara1` in dataset `ETH-UCY` as an example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>annpath</key>
    <string>./dataset_processed/ETH-UCY/zara1/ann.csv</string>
    <key>dataset</key>
    <string>ETH-UCY</string>
    <key>matrix</key>
    <array>
        <real>-42.54748107</real>
        <real>580.5664891</real>
        <real>47.29369894</real>
        <real>3.196071003</real>
    </array>
    <key>name</key>
    <string>zara1</string>
    <key>order</key>
    <array>
        <integer>0</integer>
        <integer>1</integer>
    </array>
    <key>other_files</key>
    <dict>
        <key>rgb_image</key>
        <string>./dataset_processed/ETH-UCY/zara1/ref.png</string>
        <key>segmentation_image</key>
        <string>./dataset_processed/ETH-UCY/zara1/seg.png</string>
    </dict>
    <key>paras</key>
    <array>
        <integer>10</integer>
        <integer>25</integer>
    </array>
    <key>video_path</key>
    <string>./videos/zara1.mp4</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Format of a Data File

We transform existing dataset files of each `clip` with different annotation formats into a multi-line `csv` file, where each line includes:

- **Frame ID**: ID of the frame where the current agent appears;
- **Agent Name**: Name or ID the target agent;
- **A frame of Agents' *M-Dimensional Trajectory***: Include M records of real numbers to indicate the agent's current location and other information;
- **Agent Type**: Category of the target agent.

Especially, the *M-Dimensional Trajectory* term may change over different `anntype` settings within the corresponding `split file`.
For 2D Coordinate cases (`anntype==coordinate`), it contains two numbers, `x` and `y`.
For 2D Bounding Box cases (`anntype==boundingbox`), it contains four numbers, `x_left`, `y_left`, `x_right`, `y_right`.

Each `clip` in the dataset needs to have a `csv` file corresponding to it that contains the above content.
Take the `zara1.csv` file of the `zara1` clip (2D coordinate) as an example, it contains

```xml
0,1,3.9379,13.449,Pedestrain,
0,2,4.4391,13.343,Pedestrain,
0,3,4.4391,11.912,Pedestrain,
0,4,5.1551,11.828,Pedestrain,
0,5,4.4152,8.7133,Pedestrain,
...
```

Take the `bookstore0.csv` (SDD, 2D bounding box) as an example, it contains

```xml
10064,0,10.51,1.99,10.83,2.27,"Biker"
10065,0,10.49,1.99,10.81,2.27,"Biker"
10066,0,10.47,2.01,10.78,2.29,"Biker"
10067,0,10.44,2.03,10.76,2.31,"Biker"
10068,0,10.42,2.03,10.74,2.31,"Biker"
...
```
